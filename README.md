# Micrograd in JavaScript

This is reimplementing Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd][2] in JavaScript. I'm sure its been done elsewhere, but I like the idea of implementing it.

## Install

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

Look at the `engine.test.js`. I've added property-based testing to show the power of including property-based testing with AI tools.

Since that we have the tests, we can abuse these to bring about a more Scheme like code base. An experiment with Gemini pro as the architect and Gemini flash as the coder locally in Aider.

Its mostly generated by AI, except for (the WIP) `engine-experiment.js` which is me following along with his video.
