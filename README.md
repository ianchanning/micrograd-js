# Micrograd in JavaScript

This is reimplementing Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd][2] in JavaScript. I'm sure its been done elsewhere, but I like the idea of implementing it.

## Install

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

Err... it doesn't do much else yet, I guess just look at the `engine.test.js` for examples.

Its mostly generated by AI, except for `engine-experiment.js` which is me following along with his video.

I've also added property-type testing to it to show the power of including property-type testing with AI tools.

Since that we have the tests, we can abuse these to bring about a more Scheme like code base. An experiment with Gemini pro as the architect and Gemini flash as the coder locally in Aider.
